# ToplistBot
Bruteforce voting on RuneLocus with ridiculous accuracy and speed. 


A WIP toplist voting bot programmed in Java.

Runs off of Apache HTTPClient, multi-threaded, and proxy support. 

So far it supports RuneLocus, but more toplists are to come. 

RecaptchaV3 and RecaptchaV2 is supported by 2Captcha and implemented by me.

Precautions have been taken to make sure RuneLocus votes look as real as possible and not as if a bot has made. It is up to you to use HQ proxies
